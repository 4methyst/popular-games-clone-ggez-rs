## What is this?

[![license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/MohammadAlimul/popular-games-clone-ggez-rs/blob/main/LICENSE)

This is project to make simple popular game clones and write it in rust(I am sorry if you missunderstood or have different understanding of the word "popular"). I made this repo to learn rust while also learn how to make games. If you want to take a look at my code go on. I will try my best to write good codes while also trying my best to not copy others code(I know it's impossible).

### Dependencies

Here are/is the list of dependencies this project uses:

* [ggez](https://ggez.rs)

For now there's only ggez library but i will add more eventually.

### Games

here are/is the list of games in this project:

* `Tic tac toe`

For now there's only one game presented but i will add more for sure!

You can try the game by compiling the source code or you can just download from the [release](https://github.com/MohammadAlimul/popular-games-clone-ggez-rs/releases) tab. 

### Code

I put all of the codes in the example directory. Go take a look if you want. 

If you are new to rust and want to run this code make sure you have rust and cargo installed. Go [here](https://rustup.rs) if you haven't. This repo use rustc version 1.66.0.

here's how to build and run the code.

```
git clone https://github.com/MohammadAlimul/popular-games-clone-ggez-rs.git
cd popular-games-clone-ggez-rs
cargo run --release --example tic-tac-toe
```

In this example we run the tic-tac-toe game. But you can try to run other games too!
